# Common components, temporarily does not include any third-party libraries that rely on native code

#Every time you push, the main project can be updated to the code with npm i --f RNProjectTools or yarn upgrade RNProjectTools,

# "RNProjectTools": "git+https://github.com/cham1985/RNProjectTools.git",

试着给此库加 有原生代码的库,然后在主项目引用下是否有问题,如 加  "@react-native-community/async-storage": "^1.9.0",
